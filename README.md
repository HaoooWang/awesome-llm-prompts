# awesome-llm-prompts

Prompt design is a crucial component that significantly impacts model performance. Different language models have different instruction styles, requiring tailored prompts for each model. Since there are no clear rules for newcomers, this repository collects effective prompts to help you study and understand the underlying design patterns.

These useful prompts are designed by clever researchers and engineers, including self-correction, answer reformatting, llm-as-a-judge, etc. I manually collect them from papers and other repositories. If you have a prompt that you think is useful, please feel free to contribute to the repository.
