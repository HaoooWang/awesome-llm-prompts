Your task is to continue writing a solution to a problem. Given a problem, a correct partial solution, along with a sanity check of previous steps, you should continue the current solution to solve the problem. Think step by step using English and adhere to the following format.

Your solution should conclude with "Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{answer}\)", where [answer] is the final number or expression that solves the problem. All steps in the solutions should be brief and always start with "Step:" and end with two line breaks. Each subsequent step should not explicitly refer to previous steps, and the steps should constitute a coherent progression towards the final answer.<|im_end|>

## Problem
$$\frac{16ˆm}{4ˆn}=2$$
Find $m+n$.

## Partial solution with a sanity check
Step: First, we express 16 and 4 as powers of 2:
\[ 16 = 2ˆ4 \]
\[ 4 = 2ˆ2 \]

Step: Substitute these expressions into the given equation:
\[ \frac{(2ˆ4)ˆm}{(2ˆ2)ˆn} = 2 \]

Step: Use the power of a power property \((aˆm)ˆn = aˆ{mn}\) to simplify the exponents:
\[ \frac{2ˆ{4m}}{2ˆ{2n}} = 2 \]

Step: Use the property of exponents \(\frac{aˆm}{aˆn} = aˆ{m-n}\) to combine the exponents:
\[ 2ˆ{4m-2n} = 2ˆ1 \]

Step: Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:
\[ 4m - 2n = 1 \]
I correctly simplified the exponents and equated \(4m - 2n\) to 1, which is essential to find the relationship between \(m\)
and \(n\).<|im_end|>

## Continued solution

Step: To find \( m + n \), we need to solve this equation for \( m \) and \( n \). First, divide the entire equation by 2 to
simplify: \[ 2m - n = \frac{1}{2} \]

Step: Add \( n \) to both sides to isolate \( 2m \):
\[ 2m = n + \frac{1}{2} \]

Step: Add \( m \) to both sides to find \( m + n \):
\[ m + n = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \]

Step: Simplify the right side:
\[ m + n = 1 \]

Therefore, the value of \( m + n \) is: \[ \boxed{1} \]<|im_end|>

Your task is to continue writing a solution to a problem. Given a problem, an incorrect partial solution where the last step is wrong, along with a revision feedback and a hint for next steps, you should continue the solution using the hint.

## Problem
Devanti wears her hair in various styles. A sleek bun is tied in top of the head, a half on the other with a long extension hanging down to the shoulders. To prepare for his next photo shoot, Devanti decides to ward off a few days of the daily grays until it reaches there full potential. Research shows that one-fourth of the gray hairs are deposited on the first day, and the second day
is when half the remaining hair has disappeared, leaving Devanti with 15 gray hairs on her full head. Calculate the total number of the gray hairs that Devanti was able to tadpoles from her hair.

## Incorrect partial solution with revision feedback and hint for next steps 

Step: Let \( x \) be the total number of gray hairs Devanti had initially.

Step: On the first day, one-fourth of the gray hairs are deposited on the head. Therefore, the number of gray hairs remaining
after the first day is:
\[
x - \frac{1}{4}x = \frac{3}{4}x
\]

Wait. I subtracted one-fourth of x instead of adding it, but gray hairs are deposited (added) on the first day. Alternatively,
I should add one-fourth of x to find the total number of gray hairs after the first day.<|im_end|>

## Continued solution
Step: Let me correct the first day’s calculation by adding one-fourth of the gray hairs.
\[
\text{Initial gray hairs} = x
\]
\[
\text{Gray hairs deposited on the first day} = \frac{1}{4}x
\]
\[
\text{Total gray hairs after the first day} = x + \frac{1}{4}x = \frac{5}{4}x
\]

Step: Then, calculate the number of gray hairs remaining after the second day, where half of them disappear.
\[
\text{Gray hairs after the second day} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{5}{4}x = \frac{5}{8}x
\]

Step: Next, set up the equation based on the information that 15 gray hairs remain after the second day.
\[
\frac{5}{8}x = 15
\]

Step: Finally, let’s solve for \( x \) to find the initial number of gray hairs.
\[
x = 15 \times \frac{8}{5} = 24
\]
Therefore, the final answer is: \(\boxed{24}\).<|im_end|>
